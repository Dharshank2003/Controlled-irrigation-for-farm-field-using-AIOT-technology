The project titled "Controlled Irrigation for Farm Field using AIOT Technology" focuses on using AI and IoT for smart agricultural practices, specifically irrigation. The system involves the integration of sensors (soil moisture, temperature, humidity) and an Arduino-based control unit to collect real-time data from the field. AI algorithms process this data to optimize irrigation schedules and predict crop types based on environmental conditions. The project aims to reduce water wastage, increase crop yield, and promote sustainable farming. Future enhancements may include expanded sensor networks, AI improvements, and the integration of drones for better monitoring.
